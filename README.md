A simple webapp that displays random quotes whenever the page is loaded.  
The app is based on the Django framework and uses a static list of quotes to display the quotes. The list of quotes can always be updated to display new quotes.

This webapp formed a compoment of our submission in the 2017 Inter IIT TechMeet event - Dashboard at IIT Kanpur.
